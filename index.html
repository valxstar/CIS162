            <p> 
            My name is Valeria but I like to go by Val for short. I am new to this whole coding thing but find it entertaining and have taken this course in hopes of potentially gaining knowledge that can land me a new opportunity. The design aspect of webpages could potentially be what I would like to partake in. I have always had an eye for design and being creative. Until then, I will need to master the basics. With technology moving forward at a fast pace, I hope I have found my place. </p>

  <h2> My Free Time </h2>
 <ol>
  <li> I enjoy being one with nature and exploring the different places Mother Earth has to offer </li>
<li> If I'm not alone, then I'm with my dog and family hanging out at home </li>  
     <li>I love to eat my favorite foods </li> 

            </ol>

    My favorite website is...

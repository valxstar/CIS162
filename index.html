            My name is Valeria but I like to go by Val for short. I am new to this whole coding thing but find it entertaining and have taken this course in hopes of potentially gaining knowledge that can land me a new opportunity. The design aspect of webpages could potentially be what I would like to partake in. I have always had an eye for design and being creative. Until then, I will need to master the basics. With technology moving forward at a fast pace, I hope I have found my place. </p>

             <p>My favorite hobbies include outdoor activities like sports or a simple walk in the park. I also love going to the beach and traveling all around California. I have only been out the country a handful of times but I hope one day I am able to visit Europe. Hobbies are more enjoyable when you do them with the people you love. It's always fun to go on adventures with friends, family, and your pets. </p>
